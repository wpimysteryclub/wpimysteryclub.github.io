<p>
  Welcome to the WPI Mystery Club! We're a group of passionate individuals who share a love for solving mysteries, puzzling out clues, and piecing together clues to unravel the truth behind even the most enigmatic of cases. If you're someone who enjoys a good mystery, then you've come to the right place! Our club is a welcoming community of like-minded individuals who love to get to the bottom of things, and we're always looking for new members to join us on our quests for the truth.</p>

<p>
  But there's more to our club than just solving mysteries. Decades ago, there was a mystery club at WPI that suddenly shut down, and to this day, no one knows why. This unsolved mystery has become the biggest puzzle of them all, and we're determined to solve it. As a member of our club, you'll have the opportunity to help us unravel this enigma and perhaps even bring closure to a decades-old mystery. Join us today and get on the case!
